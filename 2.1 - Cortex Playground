/*
Cortex Playground provides a powerfull way of comparing the output of different LLMs using the same prompt. The larger the model the more accurate the answer but also more costly per million tokens. 

Check table 6(a) in this document for the pricing details: https://www.snowflake.com/legal-files/CreditConsumptionTable.pdf

Navigate to AI/ML - Studio in the left hand menue. Choose Cortex Playground. Click Compare (top right) and choose two different models. 

Try different prompts, ask about Scania and ask the model to answer as different personas.
