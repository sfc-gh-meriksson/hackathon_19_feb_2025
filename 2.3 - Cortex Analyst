/*
Cortex Analyst is using a semantic model (in yaml format) to translate between strange technical colun names and business terms. It significantly simplifies the usage of business data in natural language situations.

-- first lets create a new database
CREATE DATABASE CORTEX_ANALYST;
USE DATABASE CORTEX_ANALYST;

-- Lets ccopy the shared data if we want to make changes to it
CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE DAILY_REVENUE AS SELECT * FROM REVENUE_TIMESERIES_CRYPTICNAMES.REVENUE_TIMESERIES.DAILY_REVENUE;

CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE DAILY_REVENUE_BY_PRODUCT AS SELECT * FROM 
REVENUE_TIMESERIES_CRYPTICNAMES.REVENUE_TIMESERIES.DAILY_REVENUE_BY_PRODUCT;

CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE DAILY_REVENUE_BY_REGION AS SELECT * FROM 
REVENUE_TIMESERIES_CRYPTICNAMES.REVENUE_TIMESERIES.DAILY_REVENUE_BY_REGION;

-- Compare the column names of the table DAILY_REVENUE_BY_REGION in the CORTEX_ANALYST database with the column names in of the same table in the REVENUE_TIMESERIES_PROPERNAMES database

DESC TABLE DAILY_REVENUE_BY_REGION;
DESC TABLE REVENUE_TIMESERIES_PROPERNAMES.REVENUE_TIMESERIES_PROPER_NAMES.DAILY_REVENUE_BY_REGION;


-- We need a stage for our yaml file. A stage is a storage area,
CREATE STAGE yaml_data DIRECTORY = (ENABLE = TRUE);

-- Download the file revenue_scania_analyst.yaml from Google Drive
-- Upload the file to the yaml_data stage by 
-- 1. navigating to the Databases in the left hand menue, 
-- 2. find the CORTEX_ANALYST databse and the PUBLIC schema
-- 3. go to stages and click the yaml_data stage
-- 4. click Upload file and choose the revenue_scania_analyst.yaml file you just downloaded

/*
Take a quick look at the yaml file. It contains translations between the Cryptic column names and busiess names including descriptions.

Now its time to try out the semantic model within the yaml file. Navigate to Studio under AI/ML in the left hand menue and choose Cortex Analyst. Ensure that ACOUNTADMIN is chosen as role and the COMPUTE_WH as compuyte note. Choose to use a yaml file from a stage. Choose the CORTEX_ANALYST database  and the PUBLIC  schema, select the YAML_DATA stage and choose the revenue_scania_analyst.yaml file. Once you click open Snowflake wil automatically open the semantic model generator. 

Now you can try the model by askig questions like:
What are the average cogs?
Give me the top selling product lines

Remember that the column names in the table make no sense!!
